# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end real-time retail analytics platform** built using Apache Kafka, Apache Spark Structured Streaming, PostgreSQL, and Streamlit.

Instead of processing historical sales data in batches, this system continuously streams purchase events, processes them in real time, stores them in PostgreSQL, and visualizes live business metrics through an interactive dashboard.

The project simulates a modern event-driven data architecture commonly used in retail and e-commerce systems.

---

# 🎯 Business Problem

Retail businesses require immediate visibility into sales activities to support operational and strategic decision-making.

Traditional batch ETL pipelines cannot provide real-time insights.

This project addresses that challenge by streaming purchase events continuously and enabling live analytics for:

- Sales monitoring
- Revenue tracking
- Customer activity
- Product performance
- Business dashboards

# 🔄 Streaming Pipeline

The streaming workflow consists of four main stages:

### 1️⃣ Event Producer

Python continuously generates simulated customer purchase events.

Example:

```json
{
  "customer_id":"CUST0008",
  "product_name":"Running Shoes",
  "quantity":2,
  "total_amount":659.80
}
```

---

### 2️⃣ Apache Kafka

Kafka acts as the event broker.

Each purchase event is published to the **`purchases`** topic.

---

### 3️⃣ Spark Structured Streaming

Spark continuously consumes events from Kafka and processes them as micro-batches.

Each processed batch is written into PostgreSQL.

Example output:

```
Batch 1: 1 events written to PostgreSQL.
Batch 2: 2 events written to PostgreSQL.
Batch 3: 1 events written to PostgreSQL.
```

---

### 4️⃣ Live Dashboard

Streamlit queries PostgreSQL to visualize live business metrics.

Displayed KPIs include:

- 💰 Total Revenue
- 📦 Total Orders
- 👥 Total Customers
- 💳 Average Order Value
- 📊 Revenue by Product
- 🥧 Revenue by Category
- 🌍 Revenue by City
